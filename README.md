## 📂 Uploading Files (Document Context)

You can load a .txt, .pdf, or .docx file into the chatbot to give it extra context to answer your questions more accurately.

### 📥 How to Upload a File

Type the following in the chatbot interface:

```bash
upload C:\Users\Lenovo\Downloads\Final_Database_Assignment.pdf
```
If the file exists and is supported, the chatbot will respond with:

```text
📄 File loaded into context successfully.
```
From now on, your questions will be answered with that document in mind, until you upload another or restart the session.
